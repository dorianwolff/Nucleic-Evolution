# Nucleic Evolution Website

Nucleic Evolution is turn-based card game, designed and imagined by myself, Dorian Wolff, with help of artificial intelligence.

## Disclamer

* this website and game are not finished, there may be bugs
* please do not copy the art & ideas as they are open source -> read the license for more information

## Roadmap

* the aim of this website is to become an online free to play collectible card game
* I am not good enough of a programmer to implement PVP as of now
* the AI will be upgarded, in the future a tutorial, a campaign mode and neat features will be added
* Make the game playable on phone format, as of now the website is media responsive but not the playable part
* Have fun !

## Prerequisits

Have internet access :)
